## Synopsis

This is a simple PHP/MySql site for keeping track of juice recipes. It uses:
normalize.css 
jquery 3.1.1
fonts: Montserrat and Lato

## Code Example

Simple CRUD PHP/MySQL app using jquery and normalize.css

## Motivation

I wanted a template for quickly starting new modern PHP/MySQL apps. I plan to create a library of these for a few of the commonly used web app dev stacks. Random thoughts on bits to include in variations:
MEAN
REST API
Node
Angular 2.0

## Installation

TODO: Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

TODO: Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

TODO: Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

TODO: Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

TODO: A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
